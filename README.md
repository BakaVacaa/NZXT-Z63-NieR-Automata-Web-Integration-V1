# NZXT Z63 Nier Automata Web Integration V1 forked by BakaVaca

Web interface for Kraken Z63
![Interface preview](./public/demo.png)

## Quickstart
Paste the following url in NZXT CAM: [https://greenestgreen.github.io/NZXT-NieR-Automata-Hud-Web-Integration/](https://greenestgreen.github.io/NZXT-NieR-Automata-Hud-Web-Integration/)

## Note
This was specifically made for the Z63 which has a different resolution to the Elite. If you wish to edit it, follow the steps bellow. However I am sorry to say I manually changed the pixel counts because when I was trying to automate/dynamically adjust it, it kept leaving the bounds of the circle and I am not versed well enough in CSS to fix it sorry guys.

## Installation
1 - Install Node.js  
2 - Clone the repo  
3 - Run `npm install`

Now you can manually start the interface with the command `node index.js`


Use the url [http://127.0.0.1:2553/](http://127.0.0.1:2553/) in NZXT CAM.
